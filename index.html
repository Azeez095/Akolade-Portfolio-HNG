                    enthusiastic junior front-end developer with a strong interest in 
                    creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. 
                    My journey in web development began two years ago when I started 
                    exploring HTML and CSS, and since then, I have continuously expanded 
                    my skills and knowledge in various front-end technologies.
